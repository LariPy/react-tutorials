React Challenge
Fetch API Data

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf_uNOKVSnM

Fetch API Data from typicode.

Do it like in the video.



What is required

basically there's 3 buttons on top of the screen
(button stuff doesn't matter that much,
only their functions)

the rest of the screen is for text that appears
when a button is clicked

each button fetches specific data
fetch? get? post?

use tutorial 001 as help



how to proceed exactly?

using react
install dependencies?

in the tutorial project
there's a database
API_URL
basically the target api we want to
fetch data from is this API_URL

create apiRequests.js for handling stuff?

check how buttons work from that project
come up with some css
make it so that received data is shown on the rest of the screen

that's it?



what first
need buttons
need a view that changes
when button is pressed
useState?
so view, setview?
default view empty?
this could be used by multiple buttons?
button A sets view to view A and so on?

2 buttons
square
each button changes what text is shown
inside square

in the other project
App returns Content
Content returns ItemList
ItemList is the content

in other words

fetch stuff from target api
get it to Content component
App shows Content

button is pressed
data is fetched
data is put to Content
view (table?) is changed to show Content



from Buttons.js
/*
optional stuff:
when hover over button
some sort of visual change on button

don't forget aria-label

if importing multiple buttons from one component
then perhaps I will have to make it so that
it's a section or something that has
the buttons inside
in other words import a whole section
ready made with all the buttons inside
rather than individual buttons to App

maybe have App return Header and Content (maybe Footer)
and import buttons to Header

however
if buttons are in header
and there's useState and useEffect stuff
that buttons might need...
props will have to be sent down to
content and then buttons
I guess it's not a problem though
