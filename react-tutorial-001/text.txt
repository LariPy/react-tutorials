part 06

import useState from react
now we can the useState hook inside our component
we start out by defining what we will use for state
we are going to use a name and then setName
this is array destructuring that we get from useState
first value 'name' will provide the current state at any given point in time
and setName, we can set the state with it
we can think about it like this
name is getter, setName is setter
const [getter, setter] = useState('default state')

part 08

<Component componentprop:"propname" />
const Component = (props)
<p>{props.componentprop}</p>

destructuring

const Component = ({ componentprop })
<p>{componentprop}</p>

default props

<Component />
...
Component.defaultProps = {
    prop: "Default prop"
}

moving state to the parent component
